# Decision_Tree_Classifier
decision tree classifier on simple data:

        In decision trees entropy and informaton gain are used to create nodes 
     of trees. The feature with lowest entropy inturn highest information gain 
     is choosen as the first node and to select the next nodes same procedures 
     is used. Although it involves lot of math, it all happens in the background 
     and there is no need for us to code these complex math as sklearn provides 
     us API to apply the algorithm easily.It is non linear classifier.
